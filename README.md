# Project-Skyfall
The Minecraft server nobody asked for, but everybody needs. Factorio, Frostpunk, Stardew Valley, and all the good of Minecraft, all in one.
Originally intended to be a brutal, 1:1 earth-scale factory planning, city planning, logistics nightmare (structural integrity was even considered!), turned into a beautiful clash of exploration, territory expansion, diplomatic relations, and of course city management.
